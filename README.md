# MiJia lights API project

This is the source code and instructions to control Xiaomi Mi home devices using a PlayStation4 Controller.

- `index.js` the Node.js server code
- `ps.py` Python controller button mapping with Node.js endpoints

## Why

While this doesn't have any practical value, it was a fun project! Beside the sense of achievement when I used the
controller to switch off the light was amazing.

Aside from being my first Raspberry Pi project, this is purely to demonstrate how different technologies can work
together.

## Contributing

Please do. You probably write a better JavaScript/Python than I do. I would love to see what kind of combinations and
actions you can make with the controller.
